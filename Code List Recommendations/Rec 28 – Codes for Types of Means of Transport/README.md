## I. PREAMBLE
The United Nations, through its Centre for Trade
Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT),
supports activities dedicated to improving the ability of
business, trade and administrative organizations, from
developed, developing and transitional economies, to
exchange products and relevant services effectively. Its
principal focus is on facilitating national and international
transactions, through the simplification and
harmonisation of processes, procedures and information
flows, and so contribute to the growth of global
commerce.

The UN/CEFACT work-program emphasises the need
for developing recommendations, which simplify and
harmonize the current practices and procedures used in
international transactions. Within this context, the role of
the UN/CEFACT Information Content Management
Group (ICG) is to secure the quality, relevance and
availability of code sets and code structures to support
the objectives of UN/CEFACT, including managing the
maintenance of UN/ECE Recommendations related to
codes. The ICG prepared this latest revision of the code
list for Recommendation 28.

The attached revision supersedes and replaces the code
list released with the second revision of
Recommendation 28 (CEFACT/ICG/2007/IC003)
approved by the ICG, in April 2007.

## II. CODE LIST PRESENTATION

1. The code list is presented with the following columns:

**Change indicator (CI)**

An indication of the maintenance status of individual entries in the code list.
| Sing | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| a plus sign (+) | <ins>Added</ins>. New means of transport code added in this release of the code list |
| a hash sign (#) | <ins>Changed name</ins>. Name of the means of transport code changed in this release of the code list |
| a vertical bar (\|) | <ins>Changed desciption</ins>. Description of the means of transport code changed in this release of the code list |
| a letter X (X) | <ins>Marked as deleted</ins>. Code entries marked as deleted will be retained indefinitely in the code lists. When appropriate, these entries may subsequently be reinstated via the maintenance process |
| an equals sign (=) | <ins>Reinstated</ins>. Code entries previously marked as deleted and reinstated in this release of the code list |


**Mode (M)**

Mode of transport code as defined in Recommendation 19 (Codes for Modes of Transport), in particular:

| Code | Mode of Transport |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Maritime transport |
| 2 | Rail transport |
| 3 | Road transport |
| 4 | Air transport |
| 6 | Multimodal transport |
| 7 | Fixed transport installation |
| 8 | Inland water transport |

**Code**

3-character alphanumeric code value comprising characters 0 to 9 and upper case A to Z.
In certain instances, the code value itself may be structured, where the lead character(s) represent the
general description and where the subordinate or sub-type specific descriptions are represented by
code entries with a further trailing character. For example, in maritime transport the code value "50"
represents "General cargo vessel", whilst "501" is a subordinate code entry that represents "Grain
vessel".

For ease of reference, certain code values are shown in two parts (e.g. "50 1". In use, the code
value should be a single value with no imbedded space characters (e.g. "501")


**Code name**

The name of the means of transport code

**Code description**

A plain text specification of the named means of transport code, not exceeding 350 characters in length and in English

2. For air transport (mode of transport = 4), the codes for types of means of transport are specified in the IATA
(International Air Transport Association) publication Standard Schedules Information Manual (SSIM) under the section "ATA/IATA Aircraft Types". The referenced
codes cover all aircraft that are flown, or are soon to be flown, for commercial scheduled or chartered services only, or have been announced by the manufacturer and
for which airline orders have been placed.
