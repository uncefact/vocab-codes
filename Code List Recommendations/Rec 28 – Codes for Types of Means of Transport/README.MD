# RECOMMENDATION No. 28, CODES FOR TYPES OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT

## I. PREAMBLE
The United Nations, through its Centre for Trade
Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT),
supports activities dedicated to improving the ability of
business, trade and administrative organizations, from
developed, developing and transitional economies, to
exchange products and relevant services effectively. Its
principal focus is on facilitating national and international
transactions, through the simplification and
harmonisation of processes, procedures and information
flows, and so contribute to the growth of global
commerce.

The UN/CEFACT work-program emphasises the need
for developing recommendations, which simplify and
harmonize the current practices and procedures used in
international transactions. Within this context, the role of
the UN/CEFACT Information Content Management
Group (ICG) is to secure the quality, relevance and
availability of code sets and code structures to support
the objectives of UN/CEFACT, including managing the
maintenance of UN/ECE Recommendations related to
codes. The ICG prepared this latest revision of the code
list for Recommendation 28.

The attached revision supersedes and replaces the code
list released with the second revision of
Recommendation 28 (CEFACT/ICG/2007/IC003)
approved by the ICG, in April 2007.
