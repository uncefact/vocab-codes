## I. PREAMBLE

1. The United Nations, through its Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business
(UN/CEFACT), supports activities dedicated to improving the ability of business, trade and
administrative organizations, from developed, developing and transitional economies, to
exchange products and relevant services effectively. Its principal focus is on facilitating national
and international transactions, through the simplification and harmonization of processes,
procedures and information flows, and so contribute to the growth of global commerce.3

2. The UN/CEFACT work programme emphasises the need for developing
recommendations, which simplify and harmonize the current practices and procedures used in
international transactions. Within this context, the role of the UN/CEFACT Information Content
Management Group (ICG) is to secure the quality, relevance and availability of code sets and
code structures to support the objectives of UN/CEFACT, including managing the maintenance
of UN/ECE Recommendations related to codes. The ICG prepared this latest revision of the code
list for Recommendation 24.

3. The attached revision supersedes and replaces the code list released with the fourth
