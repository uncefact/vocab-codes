## Recommendation No. 24 Trade And Transport Status Codes

 
### I. PREAMBLE 

The United Nations, through its Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), supports activities dedicated to improving the ability of business, trade and administrative organizations, from developed, developing and transitional economies, to exchange products and relevant services effectively. Its principal focus is on facilitating national and international transactions, through the simplification and harmonisation of processes, procedures and information flows, and so contribute to the growth of global commerce.[^1]

The UN/CEFACT work-program emphasises the need for developing recommendations, which simplify and harmonize the current practices and procedures used in international transactions. Within this context, the role of the UN/CEFACT Information Content Management Group (ICG) is to secure the quality, relevance and availability of code sets and code structures to support the objectives of UN/CEFACT, including managing the maintenance of UN/ECE Recommendations related to codes. The ICG prepared this latest revision of the code list for Recommendation 24. 
 
The attached revision supersedes and replaces the code list released with the third revision of Recommendation 24 (CEFACT/ICG/2007/IC002) approved by the ICG, in April, 2007.
