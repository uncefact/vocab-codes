# RECOMMENDATION No. 16, Code for Trade and Transport Locations (UN/LOCODE)

Recommendation 16 recommends a five-letter alphabetic code for abbreviating names of locations such as ports, airports, inland freight terminals, and other locations where Customs clearance of goods can take place, and whose names need to be represented unambiguously in data interchange.

The UN/LOCODEâ€™s code list is updated twice a year, and it currently contains over 103,034 locations in 249 countries and territory's location codes.
