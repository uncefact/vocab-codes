# Code List Recommendations

Codified information is an integral part of data exchange in international business whether this is on paper documents or electronic data exchange. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), through its UN Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) develops, maintains and publishes for free of charge a number of code lists used extensively in business transactions. The directory containes the list of Code List Recommendations. There are also a number of code lists maintained and published through the UN/EDIFACT standard.
